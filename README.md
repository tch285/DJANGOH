# DJANGOH - version 4.6.21 [eic] (03 July 2023)

Monte Carlo simulation for deep inelastic lepton nucleon scattering

## Overview (as given by the original developer)

DJANGOH performs event simulation of neutral and charged current 
lepton nucleon scattering. The program was developed originally 
for deep inelastic electron proton scattering at HERA, but has 
been extended and includes options for muon scattering, heavy 
nuclear targets, elastic scattering and polarized protons. 
The emphasis is put on the inclusion of radiative corrections, 
comprising single soft and hard photon emission and the complete 
set of electroweak 1-loop corrections in the Standard Model. 
Large-mass hadronic final states are generated by an interface 
to LEPTO which simulates QCD effects. Low-mass hadronic final 
states are included by an interface to SOPHIA.

## Additional notes for EIC/BNL use:

This repository is a fork of [the original DJANGOH](https://github.com/spiesber/DJANGOH)
code.  The main simulation code is untouched, but modifications 
have been made to the user routine `HSUSER` such that the event 
record contains the necessary information to make `EICTree`s.  In
addition, the `config.mk` file has been changed to direct the 
system to the correct location of the LHAPDF libraries.

DJANGOH requires an installation of LHAPDF. Either LHAPDF5 or LHAPDF6 
should work. You can check the installed version of LHAPDF by doing

```
lhapdf-config --version
```

You will also need to check that the LHAPDF libraries are in your
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. If not, run `lhapdf-config --libdir`to determine 
the location of the LHAPDF libraries.

Next, `cd` into this local repository, rename `makefile-sample` to 
`makefile` and run `make`.  In my experience, there were a ton of 
warnings, mostly yelling about obsolescent features in the Fortran 
code, but no errors.  The executable will be built in this directory.
Finally, add the following line of code to your startup script(s) 
such that it can find the right DJANGOH executable (if there are 
multiple):

```
export PATH="/path/to/DJANGOH:${PATH}"
```

Verify by trying

```
which djangoh
```

which should yield `/path/to/DJANGOH`.
